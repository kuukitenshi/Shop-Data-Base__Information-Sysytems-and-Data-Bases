# Shop Data Base

This project was a collaborative effort involving three more students for our ```Information Sysytems and Data Bases``` subject.

The objective of the project was to create a PL/SQL package to ```manage a shop's data```, including product registration, removal, returns, and purchases.

The project code include the package specification, the code itself, and a script demonstrating the package's usage.

It allowed us to gain knowledge about the internal workings of a database and enhance our proficiency in PL/SQL.

All the functionalities were successfully implemented, and we received a ```very high score```.
